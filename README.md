# Animal Database

# Description

This application allows a user to search for any animal of their choosing by Name and be presented with information and a few facts about that animal. We are planning on adding a function in the future that will allow a user to add their own comments and facts about any animal. We have implemented Handlebars.js to handle the formatting of the html pages and Sequelize to handle the server side functions. Axios is used as an additional HTTP client for the client side and animate on scroll will be used in the future for animating our fact boxes when a user scrolls through the page.
