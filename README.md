# Animal Database

# Description
Group project that utilizes both client and server side API's. This app allows a user to search for any animal of their choosing and Name and be presented and information and facts about an animal. There is also an added function that will allow a user to add their own comments and facts about any animal. We have implemented Handlebars.js to handle the formatting of the html pages and Sequelize to handle the server side functions.
